== Description ==
Don't like the site alignment? 

No clue how to get the blog feed to display in the glorious Twenty Fourteen full width? 

Want your single posts displayed in a full width format?

Prefer the menu on the left?

Want to move the content below the featured image?

Increase the content width for full width blog feed/posts? 

Then wait no more! Stop fumbling with child themes and code - all it takes is a few check boxes, make a couple of entries, save and you are done and dusted.

Fourteen Extended is the most efficient way to re-configure the Twenty Fourteen theme. It provides a TwentyFourteen Genera Option tab with options to:

1. Center align the entire site.

2. Set Blog feed to full width.

3. Set single posts to full width.

4. Set content off the featured image i.e. move content below the post featured image.

5. Adjust the content max-width up to 874px for that uniform look - default is 474px.

6. Float the Primary menu to the left.

* And more to come...

Fourteen Extended will help you center align your entire site, set your blog feed to the glorious Twenty Fourteen full width look plus an option to set the single posts to full width too! Please report any issues on the support forums.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I tried using Fourteen Extended with a theme other than Twenty Fourteen and ... =
Don't. There is a known bug where the plugin may be applied to other themes when live previewing them, but Fourteen Extended will prevent itself from functioning when the current theme is not Twenty Fourteen or a child.

= Child Themes =
Fourteen Extended is a plugin, not a child theme, because it is primarily programmatic (ie, it would only consist of a functions.php file), and for flexibility.

You can use Fourteen Extended with both the default Twenty Fourteen and its child themes. Be aware that the Fourteen Extended settings are stored with the active theme, so if you switch to a child theme or switch child themes, you'll need to re-set the configurations. Child theme compatibility depends on the extent of changes made by the child theme.
